## 💭 Why This Project Exists

Frameworks are powerful — but understanding the core is even more powerful.  
SkillShareHub was built to prove that modern UI features like live filtering, modals, and state management can be handled with **pure JavaScript**, clean structure, and thoughtful design.

This project helped reinforce concepts like:
- State management in vanilla JavaScript  
- Clean UI structure without a frontend framework  
- Debugging deployment-specific issues (especially LocalStorage on GitHub Pages)
